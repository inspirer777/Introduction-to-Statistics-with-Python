# Introduction to Statistics with Python

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to basic statistics using Python. It includes examples of calculating key statistical metrics like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and percentiles, while also showcasing handling missing values (`NaN`) and creating visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Work with Python lists, NumPy arrays, and Pandas Series.
- **Statistical Calculations**:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Variance and Standard Deviation
  - Weighted Mean, Harmonic Mean, and Geometric Mean
  - Percentiles and Range
- **Missing Value Handling**: Techniques to handle `NaN` values using NumPy and Pandas.
- **Visualization**: Simple visualizations like line plots and box plots using Matplotlib.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Using SciPy for advanced metrics like skewness and descriptive statistics.

## Libraries Used

- `math`: Basic mathematical operations.
- `statistics`: Built-in Python library for simple statistics.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- `scipy.stats`: For advanced statistical calculations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling structured datasets.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistics-with-python.git
